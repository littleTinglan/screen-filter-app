# Colorblind Friendly Screen Filter App
A WPF app that ideally would help simplify or automate the workflow for developing colorblind-friendly art assets.

## Funtionalities
There will be 2 windows, one will provide a frame to the area that the user wishes to apply colorblind filters to where the other will provide the
result after applying filters to area 1. Window 1 would "transparent" that the user will still be able to perform any actions to that area
of the screen. Window 2 would almost be a live stream of the selected area of the screen from window 1. Ideally, the user would be able to
config the update rate for window 2 for performance reasons.

## Inspiration
During my internship with Riot Games as Tool & Pipeline Tech Artist, I had the chance to talk to talented content developers in various
disciplines about tools/cheats/short cuts they were hoping to have in their daily workflows. 

This project was inspired by talking to a VFX artist. According to him, iterating assets making sure they are colorblind-friendly is pretty
tedious. It requires loading/reloading assets in the game editor, launching a local build, triggering the assets, taking a screenshot,
opening Photoshop, applying filters, iterating on the assets, and then repeat the steps above.
